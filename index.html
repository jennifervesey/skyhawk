      <h2> The University of Tennessee - Martin </h2>
      <p>The University of Tennessee - Martin was founded in 1927 as the UT Junior College. In 1951 it sold bonds and land to become the University of Tennessee Martin Branch. Martin has grown and become home to over 7,000 students. They have more than 100 areas of study and 18 undergraduate degree programs. For 17 consecutive years, UT Martin has been named the "Best College in the Southeast" by the Princeton Review.  </p>

       <h3> Captain Skyhawk </h3>
         <p> Captain Skyhawk is the most recent Mascot of UTM. The Skyhawk is not an actual bird but it is used to represent the history of Martin. Martin used to be a school for pilots. This is where the Sky comes from. Then the Red Tail Hawk is native to Tennessee. Combining these two symbols, we got to UTM Skyhawk. </p>
